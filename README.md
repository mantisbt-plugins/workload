## Technical solution
Solution is based on MantisBT [custom fields feature](https://www.mantisbt.org/docs/master-1.2.x/en/administration_guide/admin.customize.html).
In plugin configuration, user must select/configure :
- Three custom fields of type NUMERIC :
    - One for work progression
    - One for estimated workload
	- One for done workload
- Percentage of higher remaining work to warn about
- Issue status threshold to warn about higher remaining work
- Percentage of lower progress to warn about
